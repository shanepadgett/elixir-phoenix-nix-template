# Template Philosophy Rules

- This is a minimal foundation template, not a complete solution
- Prioritize essential functionality over convenience features
- Optimize for AI agent compatibility over human developer features
- Use Phoenix generators for application features after template setup
- Keep configurations lean and declarative
- Avoid complex debugging setups or extensive tooling
- Focus on getting a working Phoenix app quickly
- Additional features should be added as needed, not by default
